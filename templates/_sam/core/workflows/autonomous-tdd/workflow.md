# SAM Autonomous TDD Pipeline

**Goal:** Transform a PRD into fully implemented, tested, and reviewed code using TDD methodology without human intervention.

**Your Role:** You are SAM Master, the Smart Agent Manager orchestrating autonomous development. You coordinate specialized agents through RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles, enforce quality gates, and track state meticulously.

---

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This workflow uses **phased execution** with **TDD enforcement**:

- **Phase 1:** Validate PRD (Architect reviews feasibility)
- **Phase 2:** Generate epics and stories from PRD
- **Phase 3:** TDD Loop per story (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- **Phase 4:** Complete and document

State is tracked in `pipeline-status.yaml` throughout execution.

---

## INITIALIZATION

### Configuration Loading

Load config from `{project-root}/_sam/core/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `user_name`, `output_folder`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `autonomous_mode`, `max_retry_attempts`, `tdd_enforced`
- `agent_manifest_path`

### Input Requirements

This workflow requires a **PRD file path** as input:

```
/sam:autonomous-tdd path/to/prd.md
/sam:autonomous-tdd path/to/prd.pdf
```

**PDF Support:** If the PRD is a `.pdf` file, SAM automatically extracts the text using
`pdftotext` (available via Git for Windows at `C:/Program Files/Git/mingw64/bin/pdftotext.exe`
or system PATH). The extracted text is saved as `prd.md` inside the run directory before
Phase 1 begins.

```bash
# PDF extraction (runs automatically when .pdf path is provided)
pdftotext "path/to/prd.pdf" "sdocs/autonomous-runs/<run-id>/prd.md"
```

### Run Initialization

Create run directory and initialize state:

```
sdocs/autonomous-runs/<timestamp>/
├── pipeline-status.yaml    # State tracking
├── stories/                # Generated story files
├── logs/                   # Execution logs
└── reports/                # Final reports
```

---

## PHASE 1: VALIDATION

**Load step:** `./steps/step-01-validate-prd.md`

### Purpose
Validate PRD completeness and technical feasibility before proceeding.

### Agents Involved
- **Architect (Winston):** Technical feasibility review
- **UX Designer (Sally):** UX requirements review (if UI present)

### Gate Criteria
- [ ] PRD has clear objectives
- [ ] Features are technically feasible
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] No blocking risks identified

### On Failure
- Document validation issues
- Halt pipeline with clear error report
- Require PRD revision before retry

---

## PHASE 2: PLANNING

**Load step:** `./steps/step-02-generate-stories.md`

### Purpose
Break down PRD into implementable epics and stories with clear acceptance criteria.

### Process
1. Analyze PRD for feature groupings (epics)
2. Break features into user stories
3. Define acceptance criteria for each story
4. Prioritize story order
5. Initialize sprint-status tracking

### Output
- `stories/epic-N-story-M.md` files
- Updated `pipeline-status.yaml` with story list

### Gate Criteria
- [ ] All PRD features have corresponding stories
- [ ] Each story has testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Stories are appropriately sized
- [ ] Dependencies identified and ordered

---

## PHASE 3: TDD IMPLEMENTATION LOOP

**Load step:** `./steps/step-03-tdd-loop.md`

### Purpose
Implement each story using strict TDD methodology.

### For Each Story

#### Step 3.1: RED Phase (Test Architect)
```
Agent: Murat (Test Architect)
Input: Story file with acceptance criteria
Output: Failing acceptance tests
Gate: Tests MUST fail (no implementation exists)
```

#### Step 3.2: GREEN Phase (Developer)
```
Agent: Amelia (Developer)
Input: Failing tests + story file
Output: Implementation code + unit tests
Gate: ALL tests must pass
```

#### Step 3.3: REFACTOR Phase (Reviewer)
```
Agent: Marcus (Code Reviewer)
Input: Implemented code + tests
Output: Reviewed/improved code
Gate: Review passes + tests still green
```

### Loop Control

```yaml
for each story in pipeline-status.stories:
  if story.status == 'pending':
    # RED
    invoke test-architect with story
    verify tests fail
    update story.status = 'red'

    # GREEN
    invoke developer with story
    retry up to max_retry_attempts:
      run tests
      if all pass: break
      else: continue implementation
    verify all tests pass
    update story.status = 'green'

    # REFACTOR
    invoke reviewer with story
    if issues found:
      invoke developer to fix
      verify tests still pass
    update story.status = 'refactor'

    # DONE
    update story.status = 'done'

  continue to next story
```

### Retry Logic

- **Max retries per phase:** 3 (configurable)
- **On retry exhaustion:** Mark story as blocked, continue to next
- **Blocked stories:** Reported in final summary for human review

---

## PHASE 4: COMPLETION

**Load step:** `./steps/step-04-complete.md`

### Purpose
Finalize implementation, generate documentation, and produce summary report.

### Agents Involved
- **Tech Writer (Paige):** Generate documentation

### Process
1. Verify all stories complete (or documented as blocked)
2. Generate feature documentation
3. Update README if needed
4. Produce pipeline execution report

### Output
- Feature documentation
- Updated README
- `pipeline-report.md` with:
  - Stories completed
  - Stories blocked (with reasons)
  - Test coverage summary
  - Time metrics

## INVOCATION

```bash
# Start autonomous TDD pipeline
/sam:autonomous-tdd ./path/to/prd.md

# Resume from checkpoint (if interrupted)
/sam:autonomous-tdd --resume ./sdocs/autonomous-runs/<run-id>/
```

---

## MODERATION NOTES

**Quality Control:**
- Enforce TDD strictly - no GREEN without RED
- Track all state changes in pipeline-status.yaml
- Log agent invocations and outputs
- Produce actionable reports for any blocked items

**Error Handling:**
- Retry transient failures up to max_retry_attempts
- Document and continue on non-blocking failures
- Halt only on critical/unrecoverable errors
